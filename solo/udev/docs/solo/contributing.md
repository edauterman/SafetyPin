We are very open to contributions!

[Currently](https://github.com/solokeys/solo/issues), most work will go towards

* ~~implementing STM32L432~~
* implementing NFC
* adding documentation and improving accessability of the code

In the future, we would love to see creative plugins/extensions, putting the TRNG and other features of the STM32L432 to good use!
