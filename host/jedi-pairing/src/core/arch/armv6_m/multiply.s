@ We already implemented BigInt multiply in bigint.s, but for montgomery
@ reduction, our destination BigInt<768> is allocated on the stack. This allows
@ us to do the multiplication more efficiently, as we can access the
@ destination relative to sp, freeing up one more general-purpose register. As
@ a result, we don't have to spill to r8.

@ The macro multiply32 computes the product of two BigInt<384>s pointed to
@ by r1 and r2 and stores them in the BigInt<768> pointed to by sp. As before,
@ we split this into three parts so that additions can be done efficiently in
@ the middle.

@ Unlike in bigint.s, the macros take in a "scratch" argument that allows the
@ caller to choose one register \s to use for scratch space. The register used
@ are \s, r4, r5, r6, and r7. The scratch register can be chosen wisely to
@ avoid having to move the carry between calls to the macro. The output carry
@ is written to the scratch register.
